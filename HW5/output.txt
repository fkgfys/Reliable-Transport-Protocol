Average communication time: 18.346914070050154
==================================================

The initial value of my retransmission timer is 10.0 because the given average RTT is
about 10.0, but with this value, retransmissions always happen even if the packet is not
lost. I looked at the output trace and noticed that the RTT sometimes exceeded 10.0, so I
set the retransmission timer to a higher value, which is 30.0, then the simulation worked 
well.
